**Note**: Pirate qualification not needed to use this library.

YARR is **Y**et **A**nother **R**obotics and **R**einforcement learning framework for PyTorch.

The framework allows for asynchronous training (i.e. agent and learner running in separate processes), which makes it suitable for robot learning.
For an example of how to use this framework, see my [Attention-driven Robot Manipulation (ARM) repo](https://github.com/stepjam/ARM).

This project is mostly intended for my personal use and facilitate my research.

## Install

Ensure you have [PyTorch installed](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
Then simply run:
```bash
pip install .
```
